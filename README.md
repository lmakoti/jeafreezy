Emmanuel Jolaiya here! A GIS/Python Developer with a solid background in Remote Sensing and GIS. I volunteer, drive communities and do cool stuffs with technology. I also flourish in a multidisciplinary team. Give me a problem and I'll come back with a solution in record time.Tell me to do something,and expect it done perfectly!

Well,I can be John Snow to some programming languages,frameworks,libraries etcðŸ¤”,but I know they exist and I'm happy to pick them up when the need arises. For now, I'm all over RS & GIS(my major), Python(GIS Analysis, Django etc) and Javascript(React + WebGIS)ðŸŒ±. I'll continue to deepen my knowledge by working on projects with those technologies. However, I consider myself a forever learner, so I'm super happy to try out new techologies!ðŸ˜„

Finally, I'm looking to collaborate on high-impact projects that solve pressing problems using data and technologyðŸ‘¯. Kindly reach out here: jolaiyaemmanuel[at]gmail.com or  [@jeafreezy](https://twitter.com/jeafreezy)

Cheers!
